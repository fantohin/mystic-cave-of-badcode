redoing an idea for a game i've made in VisualBasic using direct2d in around 2010

old design:
general idea is side view rts w/ limited resources. in my game each unit dropped it essence when killed and then
you can use this essence to build same type unit. so to build units you needed right essenses and electricity generated
by special building.
there was 3 units:
worker\carrier basic unit that can go left and right and just a bit up. if you command it to fight enemy unit it tried
to get ~even vertical position & come close enough to launch a missle.
strong car like unit that could damage and push away units it comes in contact with. can't go up or down.
ufo that can go higher than any other unit... but it needs to come down to hit enemy units. 

every unit when not directly controlled will start losing altitude going down to a per unit preset height.

3 buildings:
base with a reservoir for unit essenses. could transform essenses into units.
power station. produced energy.
fence\tower like structure. pushed enemy units away if they came too close.

what i want to do now:
+platformer elements. this i will start with. think lost vikings?
